# Quick Gravity Simulation in Pygame
This is a quick thing I did while I was in study hall. All this showcases is me trying to figure out a basic gravity system without any tutorials. As you can tell by the comment inside the script file, I was incredibly excited by my success. This doesn't do much else, though. If you want to use the code in some way, you can.
